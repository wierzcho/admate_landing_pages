## What is Propaganda?

A propaganda statement is a **bold, provocative belief** that:
- Challenges conventional thinking
- Your audience can rally behind
- Positions your unique approach as the solution
- Is NOT generic advice (bad: "You need more creatives")

## Top 4 Bilingual Propaganda

*Selected for punch, rhythm, and meaning in both Polish and English*

| # | English | Polish |
|---|---------|--------|
| 1 | "Your ad account isn't broken. Your ads are just boring." | "Twoje konto reklamowe nie jest zepsute. Twoje reklamy są po prostu nudne." |
| 2 | "You don't have a scaling problem. You have a creative problem." | "Nie masz problemu ze skalowaniem. Masz problem z kreacjami." |
| 3 | "Your product isn't the problem. The way you're showing it is." | "Twój produkt nie jest problemem. Sposób, w jaki go pokazujesz - jest." |
| 4 | "The best media buyers in the world can't save a bad creative." | "Najlepsi specjaliści od Meta Ads nie uratują słabej kreacji." |

### Why These 4?
- **Translate naturally** (no awkward phrasing)
- **Maintain emotional punch** in both languages
- **Use concepts familiar** to Polish ecom owners ("skalowanie", "kreacje")
- **Short & punchy** - don't get wordy in Polish

## WINNER: "Your ad account isn't broken. Your ads are just boring."

### Why This Works
- **Provocative:** Calls out the ICP directly (slightly uncomfortable = good)
- **Shifts blame:** From algorithm/targeting to creative (something they control)
- **Positions your offer:** Creative variations = the obvious solution
- **Memorable:** Short, punchy, shareable

### The Enemy (Conventional Wisdom It Attacks)

| What They Currently Believe | The Truth |
|----------------------------|-----------|
| "The algorithm hates me" | The algorithm rewards fresh, engaging creatives |
| "I need better targeting" | Creative drives 56% of ad performance, not targeting |
| "My CPA is too high because of iOS updates" | iOS changes affected everyone - winners adapted creatives |
| "I need to hire a better media buyer" | The best media buyer can't save boring ads |
| "Facebook ads don't work anymore" | They work better than ever for those with strong creatives |

### Proof Points

- **Meta's own data:** Creative drives 56% of ad performance
- **Your client results:** Cosmetics client generating 61k PLN/month

### Variations to Test

1. "Your ad account isn't broken. Your ads are just boring."
2. "Stop blaming the algorithm. Your ads are boring."
3. "The algorithm isn't broken. Your creatives are."
4. "Meta doesn't hate you. Your ads just put people to sleep."

### How to Use This Propaganda

**Cold Outreach Hook:**
> "Most ecom owners blame the algorithm when ads stop working. But 9 times out of 10, it's not the algorithm - your ads are just boring."

**Content Pillar:**
All content reinforces "creative is king" message

**Qualification:**
Attracts owners who take responsibility, repels blamers

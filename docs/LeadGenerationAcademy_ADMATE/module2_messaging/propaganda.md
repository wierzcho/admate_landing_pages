# Propaganda (Big Idea) - admate.pl

## What is Propaganda?

A propaganda statement is a **bold, provocative belief** that:
- Challenges conventional thinking
- Your audience can rally behind
- Positions your unique approach as the solution
- Is NOT generic advice (bad: "You need more creatives")


BIG IDEA - Overall marketing strategy that everything is based around it, ads, outreach, lead magnets, email flows. 


Matt's examples GOOD ONES (from lead gen mentor perspective):
1. Every problem in your business can be traced back to you not generating enough leads
  - you have to babysit your employees because you cannot hire enough people, because you dont have enough leads, you have to hire idiots
  - you cant afford to fire your nightmare client because you are not confident enough to replace the, because you dont have enough leads
  - you've been stuck in revenue plato for too long because you are not generating enough leads to overcome your churn
  - you have too much churn because you have retards working for you because you dont generate enough leads tp hire A players


BAD EXAMPLE (too shallow, touching just surface layer):
1. you need to generate more leads -

## Top 3 Propaganda Candidates

### #1 - CORE PROPAGANDA (the spine)

**"Every problem in your ecom ads traces back to having only one way to say 'buy this.'"**

Alternative flags:
- "You do not have a scaling problem. You have a message monopoly."
- "If you have one winning angle, you do not have a marketing system. You have a fragile lucky streak."

**Pick: Option 1** — clearest, most Matt-like.

**Chain reaction (Matt-style expansion):**

Big Idea: One message cannot carry a business.

- CPAs climb → because the market has already heard your one angle and stopped responding
- Scaling stalls → because one ad story cannot support more budget without collapsing
- You feel dependent on a single winner → because you have no message bench
- Agencies "optimize settings" → because there is nothing new to say, only knobs to turn
- Competitors pass you → because they have a system that outputs 10 angles while you recycle one

**Punchline:** "Your job is not to find a new ad. Your job is to build a message bench."


### #2 - DISPLACEMENT WEAPON (aggressive acquisition angle)

**"If your agency has run the same 3 ads for 6 months, you do not have management. You have dependence."**

Variants:
- "The reason you cannot fire them is simple. You do not have a system to produce new angles."
- "Most agencies plateau because their business model cannot ship new iterations weekly."

Role: Competitor conquest ads. NOT the main big idea — it centers the agency, not her business.


### #3 - EMOTIONAL WRAPPER (the hook/opener)

**"You built a goldmine. Your ads are showing people the dirt."**

Variants:
- "Your product is premium. Your message is not."
- "The problem is not your product. It is the way you explain it."

Role: Opens the story, validates the founder, then lands the spine (#1).

## How They Work Together

**Open with #3** (emotional wrapper) → **Land the spine with #1** (core propaganda) → **Use #2** as ad angle for competitor conquest

Example flow:
> "You built a goldmine. Your ads are showing people the dirt."
> → "That disconnect happens when you only have one way to say why someone should buy."

**Unified propaganda statement (master narrative):**
> "You are sitting on a goldmine, but you only have one way to explain it. That is why your ads plateau, and why agencies keep you dependent on the same three creatives."

This becomes the master narrative for ads, outreach, lead magnets, and email flows.

## The Mechanism: The Message Bench System

Goal: Turn 1 winning message into 10 saleable angles, every week.

1. **Extract** from top 3 ads → hook, angle, objection, proof, CTA
2. **Expand** into 10 controlled variations → one variable changed at a time so learning is clean
3. **Anchor** the proof on the best-seller page → if the page does not match the promise, rebuild it in 7 days so scale holds

**Bridge to offers:**
- Offer #1 (Creative Variations) = "build the bench"
- Offer #2 (Landing Page) = "make the bench convert"
